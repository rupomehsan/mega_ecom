The Z8 is dubbed the \"ultimate hybrid camera\" because it combines the flagship's proven sensor, processor, and AF capabilities with a redesigned body design that is more suited to gimbal usage, event filming, and other handheld applications. </p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-z8/z8-001.webp\" alt=\"Nikon Z8 45.7MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>45.7MP Stacked BSI CMOS Sensor</h3><p>The 45.7MP BSI stacked CMOS sensor in FX format of Nikon Z8 provides a valuable mix of resolution, rapid readout rates, outstanding clarity, and low noise. The stacking construction helps to prevent rolling shutter, and the BSI certification provides better noise levels while operating at the upper end of the expanded ISO 32-102400 range. </p><h3>EXPEED 7 Image Processor</h3><p>The EXPEED 7 processing engine of Nikon Z8, which is about 10 times quicker than a Z7 II, complements the sensor. This engine, together with the stacked sensor architecture, results in incredibly rapid AF speeds, burst shooting rates, a large buffer capacity, smooth video performance, and snappy overall handling. Continuous shooting speeds of up to 20 frames per second in raw, 30 frames per second in JPEG, and 60 frames per second in DX. Capable of buffering over 1000 raw photos in a burst, which means raw image sequences may be captured continuously for around 50 seconds. </p><h3>493-Point Phase-Detection AF</h3><p>To provide fast and precise focusing performance, the <strong>Z8</strong> employs the trademark 493-point phase-detection AF technology. This system benefits from the Z interface's high-speed transmission as well as the sensor's speed, which allows AF measurements to occur at up to 120 fps.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-z8/z8-002.webp\" alt=\"Nikon Z8 45.7MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Subject Detection with Deep Learning Technology</h3><p>The Nikon Z8 can distinguish a wide range of unique subject categories, including persons, animals, aircraft, and bicycles.

Its enhanced AF performance, freshly designed sensor, and high-resolution 8K video recording are its standout features. The Nikon Z9, their first mirrorless flagship camera, is notable for being a camera that photographers and filmmakers using a range of applications will find appealing.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-z9/z9-001.jpg\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>45.7MP Stacked BSI CMOS Sensor</h3><p>The Nikon Z9 is powered by a newly built FX-format 45.7MP BSI stacked CMOS sensor. Its stacked construction provides quick readout rates and aids in rolling shutter reduction, while the BSI design adds to remarkable clarity and low noise when working at higher sensitivities. It also has a high-resolution chip (45.7MP) that helps landscape, portraiture, and other detail-oriented genres, as well as the ability to capture video at resolutions up to 8K. The full-frame BSI design is also noted for excellent color and detail reproduction, and this sensor has a native ISO range of 64-25600 that can be increased to ISO 32-102400.</p><h3>Electronic Shutter-Only Design</h3><p>The Nikon Z9 totally foregoes a mechanical shutter in favor of an electronic shutter for all capture modes, relying on the sensor's speed and stacking construction. The sensor's speed allows for up to 1/32,000 sec recording, and the layered construction eliminates motion distortion enabling realistic portrayal of fast-moving things such as golf clubs, baseball bats, and vehicles. In addition, despite the lack of a mechanical shutter, flash sync up to 1/200 sec. is available, as are high speed sync features.</p><h3>493-Point Phase-Detection AF</h3><p>The <strong>Nikon Z9</strong> employs a 493-point phase-detection AF system that covers the whole sensor area to achieve fast and accurate focusing performance. This system benefits from the Z interface's high-speed transmission as well as the sensor's speed, which allows AF measurements to occur at up to 120 fps. This focusing technology also works in low-light circumstances, with a Starlight mode that allows focusing down to -8.5 EV, which is ideal for astrophotography, concert photography, and other nighttime shooting applications.</p><h3>Subject Detection with Deep Learning Technology</h3><p>The 3D Tracking option makes its debut in a Nikon mirrorless camera with the Nikon Z9. This popular Nikon DSLR focusing setting works in tandem with subject recognition to latch on to rapid, erratic moving subjects that move parallel and perpendicular to the camera. There are also three Dynamic-Area AF settings with varying focus area widths for capturing a wide range of moving subject types. Firmware 2.0 now includes 20 different types of custom Wide-Area AF selection patterns, 12 of which are supported during video recording, providing more precise AF and subject identification inside a specific area of the frame. </p><h3>Up to 8K Recording Supported</h3><p>In addition to its high-end photo capabilities, the Nikon Z9 is Nikon's most competent video camera, with a range of resolutions and frame rates available up to 8K. UHD 8K 30p video may be recorded using full pixel readout, with continuous filming feasible for around 2 hours and 5 minutes. Full-frame 4K recording at up to 120p for slow-motion replay is also supported. Oversampled UHD 4K recording at up to 60p is possible with an 8K area for greater sharpness and detail. In addition, high-resolution frame grabs from 8K and 4K movies may be captured in camera for 33MP or 11MP stills, respectively.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-z9/z9-002.jpg\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>ProRes and H.265 10-Bit Internal Recording</h3><p>Internal recording in ProRes 422 HQ and H.265 codecs is possible with 10-bit color and 4:2:2 sampling, while H.264 and 4:2:0 color can be utilized depending on workflow demands. There is also a 10-bit N-Log option and a Flat color profile for extra flexibility when color grading in post. Furthermore, HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) may be utilized to create HDR-ready material directly from the camera.</p><h3>Four-Axis Tilting LCD</h3><p>The <strong>Nikon Z9</strong> has a 3.2\" 2.1m-dot four-axis tilting touchscreen LCD, a first for Nikon, which improves working from high and low angles while shooting in horizontal or vertical mode. The four-way tilting architecture of this screen enables for better viewing from a range of angles, and the user interface orientation will also change based on how the camera is handled.</p> <h3>Tough, Durable Construction</h3><p>Dual CFexpress Type B memory card slots provide flexible file storing while also promoting high-speed reading and writing to keep up with the quick continuous shooting and high-resolution 8K video recording. Both slots are also XQD memory card compatible. The Nikon Z9 is designed for professional use, with an ergonomic form factor and a vertical grip for simple transitioning between horizontal and vertical shooting configurations.</p><h3>Versatile Connectivity</h3><p>Matching the professional build quality, the <strong>Nikon Z9</strong> is fitted with a variety of connectivity options. Full-size HDMI port for video output to an external recorder or monitor. USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port for tethering, data transmission, and in-camera battery charging. The Ethernet connector provides a 1000BASE-T wired LAN connection for FTP file transfers. The 10-pin port supports a wide range of accessories and remote connectivity. PC sync port for flash synchronization. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (2.4 and 5 GHz) allow for wireless file transfer, remote camera control via a mobile device, and operate in conjunction with the NX Mobile Air software for file management.

While the camera's body design harkens back to the filmic, steel-feel functionalism of vintage SLRs, its insides are packed with the latest Z-series features and capabilities, transforming the Zf's iconic silhouette into a modern and tactile shooter that uses advanced technology to deliver timeless imagery. </p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-zf/nikon-zf-001.webp\" alt=\"Nikon Zf 24.5MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Immersive and Intuitive Design</h3><p>The machined edges, knurled dials, and marbled texture of the Zf are intended to completely immerse the user in the sensory sensation of using a beautiful machine. The dials for shutter speed, ISO, and exposure adjustment are precision-carved metal with etched markings for superior manual control. The mechanical shutter opens with a loud, commanding click. A special black-and-white mode with two monochromatic recipes is also accessible at the touch of a button. This user-friendly, haptic-friendly design isn't limited to the camera's retro-styled controls.</p><h3>24.5MP FX-Format BSI CMOS Sensor</h3><p>A 24.5MP BSI CMOS sensor of <strong>Nikon Zf</strong> is employed for all-around photography, delivering exceptional low-light image quality and quick readout times to enable continuous shooting, movies, and time-lapse recording. The sensor's back-illuminated architecture also provides visibly clear high-sensitivity output for decreased noise while operating at high ISO settings. The Zf also has a high-resolution photo mode that combines numerous exposures into a single 96MP file. </p><h3>UHD 4K Recording and Versatile Video Control</h3><p>The new shutter-priority exposure mode allows you to record with a set shutter speed while making smooth ISO and aperture changes to preserve consistent brightness in your photo. The <strong>Nikon Zf</strong>, like the camera's high-end picture features, offers a selection of frame rates and resolutions for all of your video demands. Oversampled from 6K, UHD 4K video recording with complete pixel readout up to 30p is available, and complete HD 1080p video recording with full pixel readout up to 120p for slow motion playback is also enabled. Internal 10-bit H.265 recording to a memory card for up to 125 minutes in SDR/HLG/N-log tone modes.</p><h3>Fast and Intelligent AF</h3><p>Eye-Detection AF for photo and video captures the eyes of people, dogs, and birds even when they are very small in the frame. The function Nikon Zf is now available for manual focus lenses for the first time, instantly enlarging the area surrounding the eyes so you can immediately check sharp focus.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-zf/nikon-zf-002.webp\" alt=\"Nikon Zf 24.5MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Vibration Reduction</h3><p>Sensor-shifting on five axes within the body When used with Z-mount lenses, Vibration Reduction compensates for up to 8 stops of camera motion, allowing you to drop shutter speed an incredible 8.0 stops slower than would otherwise be feasible without generating picture blur. Additionally, when utilizing the optional FTZ Adapter, this system works with modified F-mount lenses where 3-axis stabilization is employed.</p><h2>Buy Nikon Zf 24.5MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body) from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>Nikon Zf 24.5MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)</strong> From Star Tech.

With a short 16mm flange distance and a large diameter design, the Z Mount is a new feature of this high-resolution FX-format camera that enables Nikon to produce more advanced optics and compact cameras with greater power. With a native sensitivity range of ISO 64–25600 and a 45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor and an EXPEED 6 Image Processing Engine, the Z7 is one of the first models in the series and offers outstanding image quality and speed.</p><h3>45.7MP FX-Format BSI CMOS Sensor and EXPEED 6 Processor</h3><p>A 45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor is used in the Nikon Z7 for high-resolution shooting, impressive low-light quality, and fast readout speeds to benefit continuous shooting, movies, and time-lapse recording. When operating at high ISO values, up to a native ISO 25600, the back-illuminated sensor's architecture allows for substantially cleaner high-sensitivity output for reduced noise, as well as vibrant and smooth clarity at sensitivities as low as ISO 64. To maximize the sensor's clarity and resolution, the traditional optical low-pass filter was also removed from the design. The EXPEED 6 image processor, which gives the camera system a lot of speed and can shoot continuously at 9 frames per second in raw, benefits the sensor.</p><h3>4K UHD Video Recording and 8K Time-Lapse</h3><p>The Nikon Z7 is a more-than-capable multimedia camera, utilizing the sensor and processing characteristics for more than simply still pictures. UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) video recording is possible in 30p, 25p, or 24p frame rates using either the full-frame area or a DX crop region. Full HD 1080p video recording at up to 120p for slow motion playback is also available, and video files can be stored on internal memory cards or as an uncompressed file to an optional external recorder via HDMI out.</p><h3>493-Point Phase-Detect AF System</h3><p>The Nikon Z7 comes with an array of 493 phase-detect autofocus points located on the sensor cover 90% of the image area both vertically and horizontally. This allows fast and accurate focusing for both stills and video, and with a wide coverage area, subject tracking will work out to the frame's edges. For video, hybrid AF is available, which automatically switches between phase- and contrast-detect systems to provide smooth focus throughout shooting. Furthermore, the latest NIKKOR Z lenses are intended for silent operation.</p><h3>Large 3.2\" 2.1m-dot LCD screen and 3.6M-Dot Quad VGA Viewfinder</h3><p>For bright, crisp, and vivid image playback and live view filming, a 3.2\" 2.1m-dot LCD screen is provided. The screen is tilted to benefit from working from both high and low angles, and it is also a touchscreen for more intuitive operation, navigation, and setting control. The&nbsp;Nikon Z7 Mirrorless Digital Camera also has a&nbsp;3.6m-dot electronic finder for comfortable eye-level viewing. It boasts a high magnification of 0.80x and employs NIKKOR optics to ensure a sharp, clear image. The finder also includes a Fluorine coating for easier cleaning.</p><h3>Built-in SnapBridge connectivity</h3><p>Nikon Z7 Full Frame Mirrorless Digital Camera comes with built-in SnapBridge connectivity for easy transfer of low-resolution imagery and remote shooting capabilities. BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and Wi-Fi enable the connection between the camera and a smart device; additionally, the mobile device can remotely trigger the shutter and display a live view image from the camera to enable working from a distance.</p><h2 style=\"\">Buy Nikon Z7 Mirrorless Digital Camera&nbsp;from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p style=\"\">In Bangladesh, you can get an original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/nikon-z7-mirrorless-digital-camera\" target=\"\">Nikon Z7 Mirrorless Digital Camera</a>&nbsp;From Star Tech.
